## 📖 Project Overview

This project was developed as part of a web development internship task. The focus was on moving beyond basic structure to apply precise styling rules, specifically mastering spacing, borders, and layout hierarchy using the CSS Box Model.

### Key Features
* **Semantic HTML Structure:** Uses `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and SEO.
* **CSS Box Model:** implementation of:
    * **Padding:** To create breathing room within elements (e.g., skill tags, buttons).
    * **Margins:** To manage spacing between sections and layout elements.
    * **Borders:** Used for visual hierarchy (profile image, buttons).
* **Responsive Design:** Elements are spaced to look clean on different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Structure and Content.
* **CSS3:** Styling, Flexbox, and Box Model.
* **Hosting:** GitHub Pages.
